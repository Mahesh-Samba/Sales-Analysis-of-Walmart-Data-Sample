# Sales-Analysis-of-Walmart-Data-Sample

In my project on Walmart sales analysis, I built a machine learning model to predict weekly sales using a comprehensive dataset. The dataset included features such as store ID, temperature, fuel prices, festive seasons, unemployment rates, holiday flags, and weekly sales. The project involved an extensive understanding of the data, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights.

Through EDA, I identified which stores had the maximum and minimum sales, calculated statistical measures like covariance, standard deviation, and variance, and visualized data trends and patterns. These insights helped in understanding the factors influencing sales and the overall performance of different stores.

I then used various machine learning models to predict weekly sales. This included selecting relevant features, handling missing values, and training models to forecast sales accurately. The predictive models were evaluated using performance metrics to ensure their accuracy and reliability.

The results of this project provide valuable insights into sales patterns and the effectiveness of different influencing factors, which can help Walmart optimize their operations, plan inventory, and tailor marketing strategies to enhance sales performance. This comprehensive approach combining data analysis and machine learning highlights the potential of data-driven decision-making in retail.
